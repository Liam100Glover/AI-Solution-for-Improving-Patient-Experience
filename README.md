# AI-Solution-for-Improving-Patient-Experience
This project applies machine learning techniques to healthcare data in order to improve patient experience and efficiency in care delivery.
Using a synthetic healthcare dataset, the project explores predictive modeling to identify patients at risk of deterioration, aiming to support proactive, data-driven decision-making in clinical pathways.

Key Features

Conducted data preprocessing (cleaning, feature selection, normalization) to prepare healthcare data for modeling.

Implemented and compared multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks) to predict patient outcomes.

Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliability.

Visualized results with performance metrics and feature importance analysis to highlight clinical relevance.

Delivered results in a Jupyter Notebook with reproducible code and clear documentation.

Tech Stack:
Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook

Completed mid 2025
